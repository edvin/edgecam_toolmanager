# Edgecam Toolmanager

An app to manage your EdgeCam tools, written in TornadoFX, using MyBatis for DB access.

**Important notice**: This app uses the existing tool database as is, and it looks like the
people who made it have never heard of database normalization, so please only glean
information about how to use MyBatis with TornadoFX from this project and ignore anything query related :)
